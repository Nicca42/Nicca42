# Getting started with Solidity
###### Great free resources to get you started writing solidity!

### Courses:
* [ ] [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) ‚Üí An incredible intro to writing basic Solidity, as well as basic Solidity concepts. You will need metamask, and a good couple hours. Dive in!
* [ ] [Capture the Ether](https://capturetheether.com/) ‚Üí Introduce you to the adversarial world of Solidity security. It is _vital_ for every Solidity developer to understand how Solidity can be exploited. Gets hard pretty fast so don't worry if you get stuck. Go write some more Solidity and come back to it! 
* [ ] [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/) ‚Üí Another great intro to writing Solidity. Works with Remix, which is a great browser IDE you should try out!
* [ ] [Crypto Zombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course/) ‚Üí Get you writing Solidity. Not super great for anything more than that, can be quite difficult to move between levels as your code has to be formatted _exactly_ how it expects it to be. 
* [ ] [Learn `x` in `y`: Solidity](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/solidity/) ‚Üí Starts with no understanding. Explains how to use Remix and metamask. Has a great list or resources to get into at the end. 

### Mentorship:
Want a little more of a human assisted journy? Get a mentor! Can also lead to a job maybe üëÄ Depends on your mentor.

### Hackathons:
* [ ] [EthGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/) (online and in person) ‚Üí The most spectacular way to learn is to build! Hackathons are a great way to meet people and get help as you get up to speed. 
* [ ] [How to win an online hackathon and have a good time](https://vonnie610.medium.com/how-to-win-an-online-hackathon-and-have-a-good-time-29d50f411e06) ‚Üí A great article I wrote about how to get the most out of a hackathon. Enjoy! 

[Solidity Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/) are great and have lots of helpful stuff in them!
